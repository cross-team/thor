## Usage 

A banner displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). It requires a user action to be dismissed.

Banners should be displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar. They are persistent and nonmodal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact with them at any time.

## Appropriately interruptive

Banners are interruptive, but their level of interruption should match the information they contain and the context in which they appear.

## Clear

Banners communicate a succinct message and what will happen if users interact with them.

READ MORE

A banner container is rectangular, extending the full width of a layout. The container should be placed in a consistent and prominent location throughout an app, sharing the same elevation as screen content.

Only one banner should be shown at a time.

A banner appears above content and below a top app bar.

READ MORE

Buttons in banners should directly relate to a banner’s message and clearly represent the banner’s action. Buttons must be labelled with text, not icons, for clarity. Banners can contain up to two [text buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#text-button,) with the dismissive action placed on the left and the confirming action on the right.

Place buttons under the banner message, or on the same line if there is enough room to fit both.

![img](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1IfUqJUa498m1kuDMtKmFhZN3GYGUQr_8%2Fbanners-buttons-do.png)

Do.

Banners may have one or two low-emphasis text buttons.

Caution.

Avoid using a single button as a way to acknowledge a banner and dismiss it. A button to dismiss a banner should be paired with an action to address its message.

![img](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1e15aEw1pclJRvP7aYvcGO3jOwYgO2Mq7%2Fbanners-buttons-do-2.png)

Caution.

Banners are intended to be minimally interruptive. If a button in a banner requires extra emphasis, a contained, full-width button can be used for a single, prominent action (though its prominence may be distracting).

Don’t.

Don’t include links in a banner message. All available actions should be represented as buttons.

![img](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1SvpVoRIPtgR_8eEyxAe-_2Pr4vay4GaE%2Fbanners-buttons-dont-2.png)

Don’t.

Don’t combine buttons with different emphasis levels, which could appear to promote one action over another.

![img](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F15DE7Ey0rdApKwUcGlEUtYc7dELoNvYWH%2Fbanners-buttons-dont-3.png)

Caution.

Don’t stack buttons unless there isn’t sufficient room to display them side by side.

Don’t.

Don’t use a close affordance icon as the only method of dismissing a banner. All actions should be shown as text buttons.

Do.

Icons can help communicate a banner’s message.

![img](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1awRwpek-DcWicmlkUGaBlNn9-VVz_oM6%2Fbanners-imagery-dont.png)

Don’t.

An icon used as an illustration can be ambiguous and make a banner too prominent in a layout. Illustrations support the banner message and aren’t the primary method of communication.

## Placement 

Banners should be placed at the top of a layout or screen. When scrolling, banners typically move with content and scroll off the screen. Only one banner should be shown at a time.

READ MORE

Banners are placed at the top of the screen below the top app bar. They can be fixed, or scroll with content, depending on the environment:

- On mobile, they scroll off-screen with content, at the same elevation as app content.
- On desktop, they remain fixed at the top of the screen, at the same elevation as the top app bar.

Don’t.

The surface containing a banner should be clearly distinguished from the top app bar surface.

Banners in wide layouts span the entire width of the screen. They appear at the same elevation as the top app bar and remain on screen while content scrolls.

A banner in a wide layout appears at the same elevation as the top app bar.

When vertical navigation is present, banners can appear above content rather than across the full width of the screen.

A banner on a screen with a navigation drawer appears slightly above just the content (on the y-axis), at the same elevation as that content.

READ MORE

Banners typically appear when a screen loads content.

Banners that appear after a screen loads should animate on screen from the top of a layout. If the banner is at the same elevation as content, it pushes content downwards.
